   - **pyttsx3**: For converting text to speech.
   - **Pandas/Numpy** (if any data processing is involved): For managing and analyzing data.
   
3. **Vosk**:
   - Used for offline speech recognition to provide accurate transcription.
   
4. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**:
   - Helps with parsing and understanding natural language commands (if applicable).

5. **File Storage/Database**:
   - SQLite or JSON files to manage and store tasks and reminders locally (if implemented).

6. **Unit Testing**:
   - Pythonâ€™s `unittest` framework for verifying code integrity and correctness.

7. **Others**:
   - **Datetime**: To handle reminder scheduling and task deadlines.
